Frustratingly, the world is setup to encourage sickness vs. health, so our products are designed to make healthy living super-easy.</p>\n\n<p>We're an 8-figure company that's been profitable since day 1 of our founding in 2010. We\u2019re in the process of re-branding our company Metabolic Living, which more accurately reflects our full suite of products we\u2019ve developed.</p>\n\n<p>As part of that re-branding, we\u2019re porting our outdated website at <a href=\"http://www.naturalhealthsherpa.com\">www.naturalhealthsherpa.com</a> to our modernized content platform we\u2019re building at <a href=\"http://www.metabolicliving.com\">www.metabolicliving.com</a> and rolling our a state-of-the-art mobile app. As part of this migration, we have a number of exciting development projects in the works, including re-architecting our e-commerce and analytics system.</p>\n\n<p>We're riding the $250+ billion annual tidal wave of demand for natural health products. And we\u2019re positioning our new brand to be right on top of that wave. It is an extremely exciting time for us now.</p>\n\n<p>Our nutrition courses and exercise programs are designed to deliver the most results in the least time. For example, our exercise videos deliver the same or better benefits in just 15 minutes, 3 times a week than do traditional exercise programs that require 60 minutes, 5 times a week. Yes, really.</p>\n\n<p>You can see an example of one of our exercise products at <a href=\"http://www.metabolicrenewal.com\">http://www.metabolicrenewal.com</a> as our e-commerce happens on product-specific websites for now. All e-commerce will happen on <a href=\"http://www.metabolicliving.com\">http://www.metabolicliving.com</a> as part of the re-branding.</p>\n\n<p>We also formulate state-of-the-art nutritional supplements and functional foods that fuel your metabolism to generate the energy you need to consistently perform at your peak. For example, instead of taking weeks to notice a difference, it takes just days to feel better.</p>\n\n<p>We practice what we preach: our company is designed so everyone on our team both enjoys their work challenges while having plenty of time to do what they love to do the most in their life. <strong>We recruit only high-performing, humble people who produce in fast cycles,</strong> hold themselves accountable and have fun.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who We Need:</strong></p>\n\n<p>We\u2019re scouring the U.S. for a full-time, mega-productive full-stack web developer to join our team. It is a remote/work-at-home position with a very flexible work/vacation schedule as lifestyle is hugely important to our company given what we do.</p>\n\n<p>This opportunity is suited only for a high-performing full-stack developer with an integrative mindset and proven ability to get things done cleanly and on time. The ideal person is comfortable being hands-on in all facets of web engineering from the browser-to-the-code-to-the-server.</p>\n\n<p>You will work hand-in-hand with our existing CTO to optimize, support and manage our entire web infrastructure. The two of you will form our core development team, have the ability to cover for each other as vacation and other needs arise, but also to work synergistically on separate projects.</p>\n\n<p>Just as we obsess about creating healthy living products that get the most results in the least time, we\u2019re looking for someone equally obsessed about doing the same thing with beautiful, efficient code.</p>\n\n<p>While your coding skills are important, it's how fast you process information, how quickly (and accurately) you can cycle through work and how well you work with the rest of our team that's crucial.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we\u2019re looking for someone who can collaborate in real-time with the company\u2019s founder, who manages our marketing and advertising. This can require real-time communication throughout the day based on our heavy advertising spend (can reach $50k / day). The ability to turn a business conversation into an actionable set of dev tasks that you can jump on immediately is crucial.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What the Ideal Candidate Looks Like:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Deep experience as an end-to-end application/web architect responsible for every single part of the project including requirements gathering, project management, system architecture, infrastructure setup, coding, integrating with third parties and documenting and testing.</p>\n\n<p>10+ years\u2019 experience as a software engineer/web developer with recent, applicable focus on database-driven web applications on a LAMP stack.</p>\n\n<p>Expert-level, working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; our design team creates most of the assets, but you\u2019ll be implementing, optimizing, troubleshooting, and adding functionality.</p>\n\n<p>Ability to build complex PHP applications quickly, efficiently, and under pressure. Our application stack runs on CodeIgniter, so working knowledge of that framework is a plus.</p>\n\n<p>Just as good with SQL as you are with PHP with ability to write ad-hoc queries for data extracts by hand, optimize tables with 100s of millions of rows, and built new, smart database schemas.</p>\n\n<p>Familiarity with CDNs (especially Amazon S3 and CloudFront) and general web speed optimization design patterns and techniques.</p>\n\n<p>Solid knowledge of Linux, Apache, and general infrastructure/server support so you can troubleshoot and optimize as needed with our hosting team.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019re a self-starter who can take initiative and run with the ball without having to be told what to do and you love analyzing seemingly intractable problems and devising creative solutions.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019re a strong project manager who can scope out technical requirements based on business needs, define deliverables, create a project plan and then execute and deliver upon that plan.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019re available during normal ET business hours (8a-5p) with occasional off-hour support during critical business events.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What You\u2019ll Be Doing:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Primary focus will be adding features and functionality to our direct response software platform (LAMP), integrating with 3rd party tools, optimizing our web infrastructure and creating workflow automation modules.</p>\n\n<p>Designing, maintaining and enhancing internal systems, programs and web applications, including e-commerce, marketing campaign tracking, content management and more.</p>\n\n<p>Building and improving existing and new analytics and reports using MySQL, large datasets, and a custom-build replication and data warehouse engine.</p>\n\n<p>Manage asset, code, and database deployments to managed servers and cloud servers, as well as building or finding tools to improve and automate the deployment and testing process.</p>\n\n<p>Proactively suggest ways to improve any system you work with, looking for opportunities to use technology to deliver clear, measurable value to the business.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5 Key Attributes We Look

Je vindt het leuk om andere ontwikkelaars aan te sturen en te begeleiden, zodat zij beter worden in hun vak. Maar je zit ook graag bij klanten aan tafel. Je helpt ze om de juiste beslissingen te nemen, waarbij je techniek en business met elkaar in balans brengt. Of de voertaal nou Nederlands of Engels is, maakt niet uit: in beide talen voel je je prima op je gemak.<br><br><strong>Hoe ziet een dag eruit</strong><br>\nErgens in de ochtend. Je komt binnen in ons kersvers gerestylede kantoor in Amsterdam, high-fivet je collega\u2019s en pakt snel een kop koffie, want in de meetingroom zit al een sollicitant klaar. Het is een enthousiaste medior frontend developer, die heeft gereageerd op de recruitmentcampagne die je samen met een bureau hebt opgezet.<br><br>\nHet gesprek gaat fantastisch: al vanaf de eerste minuut weet je zeker dat je tegenover een rasechte Incentronaut zit. Hij is open, ondernemend, technisch goed onderlegd en blijkt ook nog eens uitstekend te kunnen windsurfen. Niet dat surfskills een vereiste zijn, maar het is altijd leuk als collega\u2019s een passie naast hun werk hebben. Je besluit om de kandidaat op staande voet aan te nemen, overlegt nog even met een collega en print dan meteen een contract uit. Handtekening erop en klaar!<br><br>\nAls dat geregeld is, loop je even naar de junior frontend developer die net uit de Young Professional Academy is gerold. Ze is bezig met een formulier dat al een tijdje op de backlog van een klant staat en vraagt zich af hoe ze ervoor kan zorgen dat de gebruiker de pagina kan vernieuwen zonder dat de ingevulde data verloren gaat. Je geeft net genoeg hints zodat ze zelf verder kan.<br><br>\nDan schuif je aan bij je collega met wie je samen een pre-salestraject doet. De uitdaging: een internationale klant wil zijn mijn-omgeving compleet migreren en restylen. Met als extra moeilijkheid dat de helft van de eindgebruikers in landen woont waar het internet nog geen topsnelheid bereikt. Je klant denkt aan een oplossing met Angular, maar jij weet zeker: deze klus schreeuwt om React. Samen met je collega bedenk je hoe je de klant van jouw advies gaat overtuigen.<br><br>\nDan is het lunchtijd, het hele kantoor neemt plaats aan de eettafel. Jij eet ook mee, maar wel een beetje snel omdat je straks naar een klant moet. Daar werkt een team van Incentro-frontenders en designers al twee maanden keihard aan een nieuwe website en jij wilt de refinement meemaken. Bovendien wil je de middag besteden aan het opzetten van Redux, waar je gisteren niet aan toe bent gekomen. Dus je houdt het bij een boterham en springt in de auto.<br><br>\nEenmaal bij de klant maak je eerst een praatje met je teamleden. Je wilt graag weten wat de status van hun werkzaamheden is en of ze je hulp ergens bij nodig hebben. Daarna sluit je aan bij de refinement. De klant heeft nieuwe user stories toegevoegd en jouw technische kennis is hard nodig om ze \u2018ready\u2019 te krijgen voor het team. Je spart met de designers, backenders en product owner en geeft aan waar nog informatie ontbreekt.<br><br>\nNa de refinement review je nog een pull-request op Github en schrijf je een stuk javascript voor een story die in de huidige sprint zit. Je wilt graag een voorzet doen zodat je teamlid ge\u00efnspireerd raakt en daarmee verder kan. De dag zit er alweer op.

We are headquartered above Tanjong Pagar in Singapore, with a great view and year round warm weather.</p>\n\n<p>Situation:\nAlibaba Group has injected two billion dollars into Lazada Group, a South East Asian conglomerate whose logistics arm, Lazada eLogistics (LeL), provides end to end logistics services and acts as a logistics marketplace.</p>\n\n<p>LeL is a data driven business, but the data function is still embryonic. Our CEO and CTO themselves are pushing for the creation of a dedicated data engineering and data science team to take its place at the centre of the company. </p>\n\n<p>A data warehouse project has begun, with 20 systems' backend databases replicated hourly or live into a multi-TB PostgreSQL instance. A \"clean\" (normalised) schema is created from it, a set of views that organises the data into a form that represents the real logic of the business cross-systems. The \"raw\" schema contains all the replicated databases, the \"logical\" schema contains the cross-system normalised information, and we're now building the part that gets from the first to the second. The result will be one of the largest <em>relational</em> PostgreSQL deployment in the world.</p>\n\n<p>The next compulsory steps will be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>To complete writing the raw-to-logical mapping, thus modelling and implementing a clean view of all the company's information.</li>\n<li>To assist, train, mentor and otherwise lead the existing team into completing the mapping.</li>\n<li>To replicate the functional spec of all existing data products within the company (mostly reports).</li>\n<li>To expand the team to cover skillsets not currently present or trainable.</li>\n<li>To build and provide the ability for the team to answer any question from any part of the business promptly and correctly (such as \"what is the average time a package between 2 and 5kg spends being picked in cold storage zones between 9 and 11am in Thailand and Myanmar a week after Chinese New Year\").</li>\n</ul><p>Optional paths thereafter could be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>To assist the CEO and CTO with their existing statistical learning projects, such as optimising the routing of millions of packages through multiple transport companies and warehouses internationally.</li>\n<li>To think of, develop and deploy other data-driven projects such as optimising warehouse picking operations or inventory management.</li>\n<li>To train local teams capable of doing the same independently, and support their efforts. This involves travelling around Asia.</li>\n</ul><p>Likely useful experience:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Software development (aside from building actual software, you'll need to read a lot of code to understand systems whose logic is not at database level).</li>\n<li>A mathematical bend, including awareness of and respect for the ideas behind the relational model (\"predicate logic on sets\") as defined by Edgar Codd and Chris Date, and rich data types. If you see a foreign key as a mathematical domain and think in terms of relation values and variables, we are probably on the same page.</li>\n<li>Knowing your way around PostgreSQL, or failing that any large scale RDBMS deployment; there are infrastructure teams and DBAs but they need your guidance.</li>\n<li>At least some enjoyment of the resolution of large, complex problems using more abstract methods as opposed to quick hacks and duct tape.</li>\n<li>UNIX/Linux, but if you've read that far you probably have more than enough experience. </li>\n<li>Speaking Chinese (Mandarin) may help a bit but the team has multiple native speakers.</li>\n</ul><p>Interview process:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Email <a href=\"mailto:vanessa.tan@lazada.com\">vanessa.tan@lazada.com</a> to be sent a few quick questions.

Our goal is to scale effectively whilst continuing to delight our users.</p>\n\n<p><em>Why join us?</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We have high codings standards, and follow best practices such as continuous testing and delivery</li>\n<li>We strive to learn and improve together in a supportive environment as the wider tech ecosystem evolves</li>\n<li>Our team enjoys a healthy work-life balance and don\u2019t think caffeine-fuelled all-nighters are a good way to grow a company that\u2019s built to last</li>\n<li>We offer flexible hours and a well-designed remote working culture built on trust. Work around your schedule and when you\u2019re most productive</li>\n<li>Our days are not full of meetings and needless distractions, allowing others to achieve flow is a big part of supporting each other</li>\n<li>Everyone is encouraged to ask questions, think creatively and suggest new working practices. We have a small team so your voice will be heard</li>\n<li>You will be provided with a laptop and are empowered to make changes that improve your working environment</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Technical challenges</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our software stack consists of a pure-Ruby backend library which we use to communicate with train booking APIs, a modern Rails application, a PostgreSQL database, and two native mobile applications (iOS and Android).</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019re integrated with multiple rail operator booking systems (with our current team we usually complete at least 1-2 major integrations each year), and we\u2019re increasingly consuming other types of data too (e.g. timetable data for routing, real-time arrivals/departures etc).</p>\n\n<p>We need to diligently manage technical complexity, as each external system works in a slightly different way, with its own features and quirks. SOAP is (unfortunately) used by many operator APIs, which is why we released our open source library, <a href=\"https://github.com/loco2/lolsoap\">LolSoap</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the most difficult challenges we face relate to routing and making sense of lots of data. Which routes are best to get from A to B? Which booking systems should be queried? How might we cache data without affecting accuracy of results?</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve recently released mobile applications for iOS and Android. Further developing our mobile strategy is a key goal for the business.</p>\n\n<p>Because Loco2 is the merchant of record for all transactions we are also responsible for fraud prevention, and handling currency and other finance-related issues.</p>\n\n<p>We frequently release new features that drive rapid organic growth, and so it\u2019s vital that we anticipate and address scaling challenges before they occur.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About you</strong></p>\n\n<p>An ideal candidate:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Has 4+ years of professional programming experience</li>\n<li>Has deep knowledge and experience of Ruby</li>\n<li>Is fluent in English and confident communicating and sharing complex information and learnings with both technical and non-technical team members</li>\n<li>Has a good working knowledge of modern devops technologies such as Docker</li>\n<li>Is comfortable designing object oriented software from scratch, not just implementing CRUD Rails apps; a pragmatist who can see the trade-offs involved in the different approaches to solving a problem</li>\n<li>Strives to discover and understand the root cause of problems, suggesting new and improved solutions, rather than treating the symptoms</li>\n<li>Actively considers future maintainability when deciding how to implement something</li>\n<li>Has a keen appetite for self-improvement and growth, but doesn't hesitate to ask for help when needed</li>\n<li>Enjoys getting their teeth stuck into complicated problems, as well as being willing to pitch in on some of the more routine tasks which inevitably arise</li>\n<li>Is willing to participate in an on-call rota to cover technical emergencies out of hours</li>\n<li>Can work hours that have some overlap with London daytime</li>\n<li>Is motivated by Loco2's mission</li>\n</ul>","how_to_apply":"<p>Email <a href=\"mailto:jobs@loco2.com\">jobs@loco2.com</a> and tell us about your skills and experience, plus include links to any relevant public repositories.
